# NOTE: Just a wishlist for now
say "testing array declarations and foreach looping"

# fixed, implicitly initialize all to NIL
let a[10]

# fixed, initialize all to zero
let b[100] = {0}
# or, initialize first two elements and the rest are NIL
let c[100] = {1, 2}

# fixed, implicit size of 5, can be mixed-type
let d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "six"]

# access through subscripts
say d[0]

# foreach loop
for (i in d)
	say i
